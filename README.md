# Movies-ETL
Bootcamp Module 8 - ETL

## Overview
We created in aoutomates pipeline in order to extract, transform and load the data from movies. We had a couple of csv files and a json file. These files had raw data with corrupted data. We had data with corrupted information. So we extracted, cleaned and then created a database so we can have better data to perform an analysis.

## Results
The last result was to have a great Postgres DB. The PNG images in the resource folder confirm we have done the job right.

##### Comments
We had to add the csv files to the .gitignore because they where too heavy for uploading to github.
